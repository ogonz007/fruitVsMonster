fruitVsMonster
==============

Oscar's old HW assignment to be augmented and played with when we need a break.

///--- Possible changes to program ---///

1) change game from random path to defined maze 
2) player can throw fruit at monster to escape
3) if player has no fruit and monster shows up, game ends
4) player can find holy hand grenade at a dead end in the maze and throw it at monster
5) print out map of maze ???
